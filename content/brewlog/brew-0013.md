I approached this brew with both excitement and trepidation owing to the fact
that I don't have any temperature control for fermentation, but really wanted
to try brewing my first lager.

Well, I say my first lager. My first lager was actually a pre-hopped LME kit
beer that I brewed with my housemates in my second year of university. With no
temperature control back then either, and no concept of how a lager should be
brewed or conditioned, we ended up with something that tased -- in the words of
our friend Sam -- like Fruit Pastels.

This beer is different in that now I'm in the privileged position of owning a
garage, which at this time of year is at perfect lager brewing temperatures.
I'm also blessed with a spare fridge that is big enough to keep a carboy of
beer safe for an extended period of lagering, and I have Michael Dawson's
wonderful Mashmaker to guide me.

**Mash**

Grain Bill:

- 4.6kg Vienna Malt
- 0.2kg CaraRed

Mash Temp: 67°C; Mash Time: 1 hour

**Boil**

Hop Schedule:

- T-60 Hallertauer Mittelfrüh for 20 IBU (52g @ 3.0%AA)
- T-0 Flameout and chill

The original recipe called for 42g of Tradition hops to reach the target
bitterness of 26 IBU, but my LHBS only had Hallertauer at 3%AA. That would mean
I'd hve to use >70g to hit 26, so I chose to undershoot the bitterness, which
isn't really a problem considering most of my family and friends prefer their
lagers less challenging in that dimension.
