# Atom One Pygments

> A tool for generating [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) and [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) stylesheets using Atom's lovely One Dark and One Light Syntax themes.

# How it works

NPM scripts are used to copy the LESS stylesheet files from [One Dark Syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) and [One Light Syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-light-syntax) into a `temp` folder, at which point each of them are converted to vanilla CSS using the LESS compiler, and minified with [clean-css](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css) before being output to the `dist` directory.

Supports code snippets generated with **Pygments 2.2.0 and earlier**, and includes the [`user-select`](http://devdocs.io/css/user-select) css selection rule on the `linenos` class in an effort to help prevent users from copying line numbers when selecting code snippets.

# Usage

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`
1. Install NPM dependencies with `npm i`
1. Run `npm run build` to generate stylesheets

The above will generate two minified stylesheets in the `dist` directory, aptly named `dark.css` and `light.css`, for use in highlighting code.

**Note:** By default, generated stylesheets assume your highlighted code sits in a container with class `highlight`, e.g.

```html
<div class="highlight">
  <pre>
    <code>...</code>
  </pre>
</div>
```

If you are using a different wrapper class with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/), the wrapper name can be changed in `pygments.less` before building. Additional customizations are also possible as outlined in the file. Get creative.
