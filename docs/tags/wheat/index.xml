      <description>This beer has a bit of a history. It&amp;rsquo;s originally from Home Brew Beer by Greg Hughes, which I first brewed as a partial extract batch way back in 2014. It went down really well with my wife, so I brewed it again when we were expecting our first child.
It was really nice celebrating the birth (and her ability to drink again) with a cold refreshing glass of the pink stuff.</description>
