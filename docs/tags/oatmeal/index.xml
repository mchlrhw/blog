      <description>Confession time: this isn&amp;rsquo;t my 14th brew, it&amp;rsquo;s my 15th, but for the sake of cataloguing brews that were drinkable I&amp;rsquo;m only going to give beers a number if they make it all the way to my glass.
My 14th, unnamed and undrinkable, brew went extremely well, up to the point that I tried to ferment it. I gave decoction another go and the yield was so good that I ended up extracting way more sugars than I needed and decided to dilute to 23 litres in order to hit the correct OG.</description>
