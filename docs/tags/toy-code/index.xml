      <description>In the previous two posts I covered recursion, mutual recursion, primality testing and prime generation. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll close the loop (or maybe that should be loops) by making all of the functions we&amp;rsquo;ve covered so far interdependent, so that no matter which one we call there&amp;rsquo;s always a chance that all of them will find there way onto the call stack.
Everything Depends on Something
What a shame primes_to is only ever called if we call it.</description>

      <description>In the previous post I talked about what recursion is, what it takes for a number to be prime, and how we can apply recursion to the problem of primality testing and prime factorisation. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll take the next logical step: finding primes in a sea of integers.
Hunting for Primes
So, after the work we did in the previous post, we now have two functions that depend on each other to work at all; but we can do better.</description>

      <description>OK, I admit it&amp;hellip; I love prime numbers. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I know I&amp;rsquo;m not alone. There&amp;rsquo;s just something about them. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s their indivisible nature &amp;ndash; their atomicity &amp;ndash; that seems so appealing. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that they&amp;rsquo;re well understood, but nevertheless intangible &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s no equation for finding primes and most of our methods for finding them involve brute-force. Anyway, whatever it is, I just love them and I love writing code to generate them.</description>
