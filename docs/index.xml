      <description>In the previous two posts I covered recursion, mutual recursion, primality testing and prime generation. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll close the loop (or maybe that should be loops) by making all of the functions we&amp;rsquo;ve covered so far interdependent, so that no matter which one we call there&amp;rsquo;s always a chance that all of them will find there way onto the call stack.
Everything Depends on Something
What a shame primes_to is only ever called if we call it.</description>

      <description>In the previous post I talked about what recursion is, what it takes for a number to be prime, and how we can apply recursion to the problem of primality testing and prime factorisation. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll take the next logical step: finding primes in a sea of integers.
Hunting for Primes
So, after the work we did in the previous post, we now have two functions that depend on each other to work at all; but we can do better.</description>

      <description>OK, I admit it&amp;hellip; I love prime numbers. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I know I&amp;rsquo;m not alone. There&amp;rsquo;s just something about them. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s their indivisible nature &amp;ndash; their atomicity &amp;ndash; that seems so appealing. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that they&amp;rsquo;re well understood, but nevertheless intangible &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s no equation for finding primes and most of our methods for finding them involve brute-force. Anyway, whatever it is, I just love them and I love writing code to generate them.</description>

      <description>I approached this brew with both excitement and trepidation owing to the fact that I have limited temperature control for fermentation, but really wanted to try brewing my first lager.
Well, I say my first lager. My first lager was actually a pre-hopped LME kit beer that I brewed with my housemates in my second year of university. With no temperature control back then at all, and no concept of how a lager should be brewed or conditioned, we ended up with something that tasted &amp;ndash; in the words of our friend Sam &amp;ndash; like Fruit Pastels.</description>

      <description>This beer has a bit of a history. It&amp;rsquo;s originally from Home Brew Beer by Greg Hughes, which I first brewed as a partial extract batch way back in 2014. It went down really well with my wife, so I brewed it again when we were expecting our first child.
It was really nice celebrating the birth (and her ability to drink again) with a cold refreshing glass of the pink stuff.</description>
